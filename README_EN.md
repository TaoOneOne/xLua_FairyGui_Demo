## Lua programming solution for C#

xLua adds Lua scripting capability to Unity, .Net, Mono, and other C# environments. With xLua, Lua code and C# code can easily call each other.

## xLua's superior features

xLua has many breakthroughs in function, performance, and ease of use. The most significant features are:

* You can inplace C# implementations (methods, operators, properties, events, etc...) by Lua's during runtime.
* Outstanding GC optimization, customized struct, no C# gc alloc when passing the enumerated objects between C# and lua;
* Lightweight development with no needs to generate code in editor mode;

## Installation

Unpack the zip package and you will see an Assets directory, which corresponds to the Unity project's Assets directory. Keep the directory structure in your Unity project.

If you want to install it to another directory, please see the [FAQs](Assets/XLua/Doc/Faq_EN.md).

## Quick Start

A complete example requires only 3 lines of code:

Install xLua, create a MonoBehaviour drag scenario, add the following code to Start:

```csharp
XLua.LuaEnv luaenv = new XLua.LuaEnv();
luaenv.DoString("CS.UnityEngine.Debug.Log('hello world')");
luaenv.Dispose();
```

1. The DoString parameter is a string, and you can enter any allowable Lua code. In this example, Lua calls C#â€™s UnityEngine.Debug.Log to print a log.

2. A LuaEnv instance corresponds to a Lua virtual machine. Due to overhead, it is recommended that the Lua virtual machine be globally unique.

It is simple that C# actively calls Lua. For example, the recommended method to call Lua's system function is:

* Declare

```csharp
[XLua.CSharpCallLua]
public delegate double LuaMax(double a, double b);
```

* Bind

```csharp
var max = luaenv.Global.GetInPath<LuaMax>("math.max");
```

* Call

```csharp
Debug.Log("max:" + max(32, 12));
```

It is recommended that you bind once and reuse it. If code is generated, no gc alloc is generated when calling max.

## Hotfix

* This has lower intrusiveness, and it can be used without any modification of the original code of the old project.
* This has little impact on the runtime, which is almost the same as the original program which hotfix is not used.
* If you have problems, you can also use Lua to patch. Then the Lua code logic is involved.

[Here](Assets/XLua/Doc/Hotfix_EN.md) is the usage guide:

## Lua 5.3 vs LuaJIT

There are two versions of xLua, which integrate Lua 5.3 and LuaJIT respectively. Choose one of them for each project. The C# code in the two versions are the same, except for the Plugins.

Lua 5.3 has richer features, such as support for native 64-bit integers, Apple Bitcode, UTF-8, and so on. Any problems that exist are caused by pure C code, and positioning is easy. Lua has less impact on the installation package than LuaJIT.

Also, LuaJIT has higher performance. Its performance is an order of magnitude higher than Lua if its JIT is not faulty. At present, the LuaJIT developer does not plan to maintain LuaJIT. He is looking for someone to take over the maintenance, the outlook remaining uncertain.

The project manager can determine which solutiuon is more suitable accordingly. Because Lua 5.3 is currently used more often, and the default package in the Plugins directory of the xLua project is Lua 5.3.
